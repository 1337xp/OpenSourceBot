# OpenSourceBot

OpenSourceBot is a completely customizable discord bot base for use in a wide range of server sizes, from small bots to largescale based bots

## Installation

Clone the repository, or download it as a zip.  
Make sure to install the dependencies beforehand.  
Extract the zip and run `main.py`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Requirements
This bot requires Python 3.8 and above to work properly.  
The base bot is basic enough to run on really slow PCs, I have tested it on a Raspberry Pi 3 and it runs flawlessy.
```bash
pip install discord
```
or
```bash
pip3 install discord
```
## Usage
Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and enter your bot token into the correct field.
```bash
python main.py
```
or 
```bash
python3 main.py
```
